# Inukshuk — agent & contributor guide

Offline trail-navigation app: georeferenced PDF maps + OSM base layer + GPX
route recording. Expo SDK 56 / React Native 0.85 / React 19 / TypeScript.

## Before writing native/Expo code

Expo APIs change between SDKs. Read the **versioned** docs for SDK 56:
https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v56.0.0/ — notably `expo-file-system` uses the
new `File`/`Directory`/`Paths` API (not the legacy `readAsStringAsync` API).

## Conventions

- **Keep `src/core/**`pure** — no`react-native`/`expo`imports there. It's the
unit-tested logic layer (georeferencing, GPX, track math) with a coverage gate.
Platform code goes in`src/data`(persistence),`src/state`(Zustand),`src/features` (screens/hooks).
- **Path aliases**: `@core`, `@data`, `@state`, `@features`, `@ui`, `@lib`, `@/`.
  Declared in `tsconfig.json` + `jest.config.js` — keep them in sync.
- **Strict TS**: `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Index access is
  `T | undefined`; guard it, don't cast it away.
- **Before committing**, run `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + format + tests).
  Lint allows **zero** warnings. Prettier: single quotes, semicolons, width 100.
- New pure logic in `src/core` must come with co-located `*.test.ts`.

## Layout

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Routes are in `app/` (expo-router); each route file
just renders a screen from `src/features`.

## CI / deploy

`docs/CI.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. Workflows that need store/EAS secrets
no-op until those secrets are configured.
