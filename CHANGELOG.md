# Changelog

All notable changes to Inukshuk are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Field updates (JS/asset-only) ship over-the-air via EAS Update to installed apps
on the same app version; native changes require a new store build. See
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Multi-page georeferenced PDFs no longer crash the app.** A projected `/GCS`
  (e.g. UTM) in an Adobe GEO viewport caused the geographic `GPTS` to be wrongly
  reprojected, collapsing every page to a degenerate point near the equator; the
  resulting zero-area image quad crashed MapLibre natively, and because the import
  was the active map it re-crashed on every launch. GPTS are now treated as
  geographic per ISO 32000-2, and overlays validate their corners (finite,
  in-range, non-degenerate) before reaching the native layer.

### Added

- **Per-page overlay selection.** A multi-page PDF now lists each georeferenced
  page in the Library with a checkbox; any combination of pages (across one or
  more PDFs) can be shown on the map at once. Overlapping overlays are allowed.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-16

First public release: an offline trail-navigation app built around your own
georeferenced PDF maps. Initial distribution to the Google Play **internal
testing** track (Android).

### Maps

- **Import georeferenced PDF maps** and overlay them, correctly aligned, on a
  live map. Georeferencing is read from, in order:
  - Adobe ISO-32000 geospatial dictionaries (`/VP`, `/Measure`, `/GEO`);
  - OGC **LGIDict** control points and neatlines;
  - sidecar **world files** (`.pgw` / `.pdfw`);
  - GDAL **`.aux.xml`** sidecars.
- **Coordinate-system reprojection** to WGS84 via proj4, so maps in regional
  projections line up with GPS.
- **Full-page overlay extrapolation** — when only the map frame carries
  georeferencing, the full page is affine-extrapolated so the whole sheet
  overlays.
- PDFs **without** any georeferencing still import as plain documents (flagged
  in the library), so nothing is lost.
- **OpenStreetMap base layer** (MapLibre raster tiles) underneath, with a
  configurable tile URL.
- Toggle the PDF overlay on/off from the map.

### Location & navigation

- **Live GPS position** on the map, foreground-only (no background tracking).
- **Follow-me camera** that keeps you centered.
- **Compass heading badge** from device sensors.

### Trail recording

- **Record trails** with a live heads-up display: elapsed time, distance,
  elevation gain/loss (D+/D-), speed, and max altitude.
- **Pause / resume / stop**, with the screen kept awake while recording
  (optional).
- **GPS-noise suppression** — elevation gain/loss uses a hysteresis filter so a
  flat walk doesn't accumulate phantom climb.
- Recordings are saved as standard **GPX 1.1**.

### Library

- Manage imported **maps**: set the active map, see georeferencing status,
  delete.
- Browse **recorded trails** with distance and elevation summary, **view a
  trail on the map**, **share its GPX**, or delete it.
- **Elevation profile** per trail — expand a trail to see an
  elevation-vs-distance graph, and touch-and-drag to read the elevation and
  distance at any point. _(Delivered to 1.0.0 devices via the first
  over-the-air update.)_

### Settings

- Keep the screen awake while recording.
- GPS point spacing (2 m / 5 m / 10 m) to trade detail for battery.
- Custom base-map tile URL (defaults to OpenStreetMap).
- Reset to defaults; about/version info.

### Privacy

- **Foreground-only location**, used solely to show your position and record
  trails. No background location, no accounts, no analytics, no data leaves the
  device except when you explicitly share a GPX file. Privacy policy bundled
  with the app.

### Under the hood

- Expo SDK 56 / React Native 0.85 / React 19 / TypeScript (strict).
- Pure, unit-tested core logic (georeferencing, GPX I/O, track math) behind a
  coverage gate; platform code kept thin.
- **Over-the-air updates** wired via EAS Update for JS/asset-only fixes.
- CI runs typecheck, lint (zero warnings), format check, and tests; release
  builds and store submission are automated through EAS.
